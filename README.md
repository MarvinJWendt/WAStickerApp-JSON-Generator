# WAStickerApp-JSON-Generator
Select image files from folder and get your JSON ready. Create Now : http://pratikbutani.com/wastickerapp/

I have created script that will give you JSON of selected files.

[Convert Image names to JSON Array (WAStickerApp)](http://pratikbutani.com/wastickerapp/)

That will allows you to:
- Select 30 Images (Must be **webp**)
- JSON Array of Name of Selected Files 

**Format:**
```
[
    {
        "image_file":"1.webp",
        "emojis":[
            "â˜•",
            "ðŸ™‚"
        ]
    },
    {
        "image_file":"2.webp",
        "emojis":[
            "ðŸ˜„",
            "ðŸ˜€"
        ]
    },
    {
        "image_file":"3.webp",
        "emojis":[
            "â˜•",
            "ðŸ™‚"
        ]
    }
]
```

I will try to add more functionality like developer can input publisher name, email, Android/iOS link etc...

Hope it will helps.

Thank you.
